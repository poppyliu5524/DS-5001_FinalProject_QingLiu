03_004_22c_061,8,thank,1
03_004_22c_061,9,thing kind parts feedback scenario first part make sure pretty timely manner students students allow student stop situation many situations real world student pick cue stop want talk kind continue continue like respond behavior specific redirection make sense,41
03_004_22c_061,10,main reason point tell know,4
03_004_22c_061,11,little bit challenge figure simulation um make sure pretty quick get discussion classroom norms long conversation get classroom norms simulation small time valuable classroom think redirect students make sure specific part specific redirection students sure whistling stop um times listen able whistle listen time students say stop whistling put hands lap stop drumming way give specific redirection student sure student name behavior stop look behavior example say stop drumming put hands lap uh,93

03_004_22c_073,1,start reflect,1
03_004_22c_073,2,know stop like cut,3
03_004_22c_073,3,simulation give practice say first nice job behavior teachers know ignore redirect behavior get task talk today way effective sort keep behavior tell little bit work get student stop task,29
03_004_22c_073,4,kind redirect back topic let know like like let let hear end rule interrupt know rule class let everybody speak,22
03_004_22c_073,5,lot sense idea tell students right thing sort change little bit specific observable ambiguity students keep sort signal like oh leeway wiggle room kind figure teacher hard time come new ways say things keep students find new little ways wiggle sort clear wiggle room redirection give example say something ethan please stop drumming please stop drumming answer question classroom norms,59
03_004_22c_073,7,make sense,3
03_004_22c_073,9,different first simulation,2
03_004_22c_073,10,kind stop whenever say get discussion classmates tell stop second step,11
