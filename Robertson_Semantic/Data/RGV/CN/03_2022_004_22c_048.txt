All righty, thank you so much for completing that simulation you made it through I know that that is a long one. Okay. You're gonna spend five minutes now in just sort of reflecting and thinking about how that went so I just dropped a self reflection survey in the chat if you could click on that and make sure that it opens give me 

Participant Okay, I got it. 

Coach
Okay, perfect. So you have five minutes to complete this self reflection Please take your time your thoroughness is appreciated I'm gonna turn off my camera but if you are ready to proceed just let me know and we will move into the second round okay?

Participant  1:01  
I'm ready.

Coach
Okey dokey. Thank you so much for completing that self reflection. You are now going to get the opportunity to try that same simulation again from the beginning. So same objective, you're still trying to have a discussion with the students about your classroom norms for the year. Can I answer any questions for you before we get into round two? 

Participant 
Yes, I have a question. Was it only three? Or could I have said more you can do more you can do both. You're welcome to do more than that. It's that's just sort of like a goal is to do two or three. And you might also like talk about why those norms are good, but it's totally up to you. That's a really good question. All right. Anything else? No, that's okay. Sounds good. Let's go ahead and begin simulation
